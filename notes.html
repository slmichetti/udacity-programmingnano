<h1>My HTML Notes</h1>
<p> This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!</p>

<h2> The Web</h2>
	<p> The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files. Most of the documents are made using HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</p>

<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
	<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> It's used to define the structure or layout of a web page.</p>

<h2>Markup</h2>
	<p>Markup gives instructions to the browser on things like how text should be displayed or arranged. It is an indicator of when something has a <em>special</em> meaning.</p>
<br>

<h2>Typographic Elements</h2>
	<p>This is a story all about how life got <sub>flipped</sub>, <sup>turned upside down</sup> ...</p>
<br>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Three steps to fire safety</p>
<ol>
	<li>Stop</li>
	<li>Drop</li>
	<li>Roll</li>
</ol>
<p>Home Safety items you should always have on hand</p>
<ul>
	<li>Smoke Detector</li>
	<li>Fire Extinguisher</li>
	<li>First Aid Kit</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Optional Closing Tags</h2>
Two elments that have optional closing tags are the p and li. <br>
<ul>
	<li>The p element does not require a closing tag because when the browser sees another p element or an element that cant be inside of the last one, it will automatically close that p element.</li>
	<li>The li element is similar in that the browser knows a list cant exist on its own, so it knows when it sees another li to close the prior one.
