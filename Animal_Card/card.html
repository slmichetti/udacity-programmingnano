					Pit Bulls are highly a misunderstood dog breed. Contrary to popular belief, these dogs are among the most affectionate and lovable breeds. Historically, Pit Bulls were American Heroes, serving alongside soldiers during World War I and II, and being featured as the US Army mascot on recruiting posters to characterize the United States loyalty, determination and bravery.They also make wonderful therapy, law enforcement, search and resuce dogs as well as amazing family pets that love to cuddle, play and lay in your lap. Irresponsible dog ownership and negative media attention has since tarnished the reputation of a breed formerly considered "America's Dog".
